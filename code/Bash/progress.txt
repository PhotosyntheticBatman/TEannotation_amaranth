+ Should not add everything in the working directory.....


+ Try #2...

$ git reset .
Unstaged changes after reset:
D       token.txt

+ Try to see the difference

$ git diff
diff --git a/token.txt b/token.txt
deleted file mode 100644
index 1af9a0a..0000000
--- a/token.txt
+++ /dev/null

$ git commit -m "delete token"
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add/rm <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
        deleted:    token.txt

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
        .gitignore
        code/
        data/
        progress_general_log.txt

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")

+ Finally realize how to delete the file......

$ git rm token.txt
rm 'token.txt'

$ git commit -m "delete token for real"
[main 69eb4c1] delete token for real
 1 file changed, 1 deletion(-)
 delete mode 100644 token.txt
